"""
This module contains stuff to work with factors data. Factors are drivers of returns on the stock
(and any other) market, explaining the risks of investing into assets. We assume that a factor can
be presented by simple table (pandas DataFrame), where each row represents a timestamp, each
column - a stock (ticker) and each cell - value of the factor for the stock in the timestamp.

You must be accurate to work with such type of data, because it is very easy to forget about
look-ahead bias and to build very profitable, but unrealistic factor model or portfolio. There are
already included "batteries" to transform factors with looking, lag and holding periods to avoid it.

Factors can be dynamic or static. Static factor is a factor, for which is not necessary to calculate
the change, its value can be compared across the stocks straightly (e.g. P/E). Dynamic factor is
a factor, which values must be recalculated to get the percentage changes to work with them
(e.g. Momentum). Start of testing for dynamic factors will be 1 period later to avoid look-ahead
bias.

Factors also have one more characteristic - whether values of factor is better to be bigger or
lower. For example, we usually want to pick into portfolio stocks with low P/E, hence, this factor
is "lower better", whereas stocks with high ROA are usually more preferable, hence, this factor is
"bigger better". This characteristic affects building wml-portfolios.
