"""
This module contains stuff to create portfolios of stocks. Portfolio is a rebalancing each period
batch of stocks. So, portfolio can be represented as matrix with zeros on cells, where a stock is
not picked, and weights (or lots) on cells, where a stock is picked into a portfolio.

Portfolio can be constructed relatively or with money. Relative portfolio is a theoretical
portfolio, built up with assumption that all available money is invested in each period (and each
period returns are reinvested). Money portfolio is a more realistic portfolio, which operates with
real balance, which imposes restrictions on the process of investing: practically never weights of
positions are equal to theoretical weights (because of indivisibility of stocks). Money portfolio is
going close to relative one with initial balance going to infinity.
