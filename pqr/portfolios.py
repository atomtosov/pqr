"""
This module contains stuff to create portfolios of stocks. Portfolio is a
rebalancing each period batch of stocks. So, portfolio can be represented as
matrix with zeros on cells, where a stock is not picked, and weights (or lots)
on cells, where a stock is picked into a portfolio.

Portfolio can be constructed relatively or with money. Relative portfolio is a
theoretical portfolio, built up with assumption that all available money is
invested in each period (and each period returns are reinvested). Money
portfolio is a more realistic portfolio, which operates with real balance,
which imposes restrictions on the process of investing: practically never
weights of positions are equal to theoretical weights (because of
indivisibility of stocks). Money portfolio is going close to relative one with
initial balance going to infinity.

Also, portfolio can be winners-minus-losers if you construct a factor model.
This type of portfolio is supported, but without real allocation: positions of
winners and losers portfolios a simply used as positions for the wml-portfolio.
Moreover, this portfolio is always theoretical, as it is assumed as
self-financing portfolio (money from shorts are used to long stocks).

Random portfolios to test performance of your portfolio are also supported, but
only for long-only (not wml) portfolios.
