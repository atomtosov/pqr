"""
This module contains all necessary functionality to create factor models. Factor model is the set of
portfolios, covering all stock universe in each period. It is used to test whether any factor is
present on the market or not, that is why full coverage of stock universe is important.

Usually factor models are built for single-factors with the quantiles method. So, only this way to
fit factor models is natively supported, but if you need to make full coverage of stock universe
with time-series method or top-n portfolios, you can make it by yourself, using portfolios module.

Users of factor models are often interested in performance of the wml-portfolio, and this
functionality is also supported.

Moreover, you can calibrate factor model parameters, using simple bruteforce method, provided by
grid_search() function.
