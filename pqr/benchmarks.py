"""
This module provides instruments to create benchmarks. Benchmarks treated as
theoretical portfolios, which each investor dreams to beat. Usually there are
already good benchmarks - indices (e.g. S&P 500 or IMOEX). But if for some
reason you cannot find suitable benchmark you can build it from stock universe
(with filters and weights, but without selecting stocks). The benchmark will
include all available (filtered) stock universe in each period  without
transaction costs, but with weighting positions (optionally).

In most cases you need a benchmark just to compare its performance with
performance of a portfolio, but do not forget, that portfolios are also can be
used as benchmarks for calculating metrics/plotting the performance. If you
want to create benchmark with selecting stocks, just construct the portfolio.

        Creates benchmark from stock universe.

        This type of a benchmark should be used, when there is no relevant
        index to compare with portfolios (e.g. if stock universe is too
        specific or just is severe filtered). In other cases it is highly
        recommended to download data for some existing benchmark, because it is
        really hard to accurately replicate any real stock index.

        To build a benchmark from stock universe you can use filtration and
        weighting, but not picking the stocks. If picking is needed, just
        construct the portfolio, it also can be used as benchmark.

        Parameters
        ----------
        stock_prices
            Prices, representing stock universe. All of available (not np.nan)
            for selecting stocks are picked into the "benchmark-portfolio".
        mask
            Mask to filter stock universe.
        weighting_factor
            Factor, weighting positions (if you want to replicate some
            market-cap weighted benchmark). If not passed, weighs positions
            equally.
        is_bigger_better
            Whether bigger values of `weighting_factor` will lead to bigger
            weights for a position or on the contrary to lower.
